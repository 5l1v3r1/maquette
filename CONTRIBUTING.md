# Building
Maquette is written in Typescript. The main sourcefiles can be found under `src/`. Unit-tests are in the `test` folder. You can use your IDE to run
unit tests or run `npm run assist` to run the unit tests on every save.

The code is formatted using the coding style we use at AFAS. You can simply use `npm run fix` to reformat the changed code and find linting problems.
Git hooks are added during `npm install` to help you keep the code formatted before committing and thus prevent extra style-fixing commits.

Happy coding!
