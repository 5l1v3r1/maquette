Domsetter
=========

Domsetter is a javascript library which makes it easy to synchronize data with the DOM tree in the browser.
It uses a technique called 'Virtual DOM'. Compared to other virtual DOM implementations, domsetter is very
lightweight and it is able to apply animations when dom nodes are added, removed or updated.
